    <string name="revanced">ReVanced Manager produces an error when attempting to patch merged APKs. The error is not an actual problem and is produced incorrectly by a third party library. For most people, using the option to select splits for your device specifications will fix it. If it still doesn\'t work, the easiest thing to do is download a version of ReVanced Manager with the error removed.</string>
